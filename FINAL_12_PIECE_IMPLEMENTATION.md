# âœ… 12-Piece Post-Revive Fix - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully updated the post-revive system to track **12 individual pieces** instead of 4 rounds, ensuring exactly what the user requested: the next 12 pieces after revival are guaranteed to be placeable.

## Changes Made

### 1. GameController.swift - Updated Tracking System

- **Constants**: Changed from `postRevivePriorityRounds: 4` to `postRevivePriorityPieces: 12`
- **Variables**: Changed from `postReviveRoundsRemaining` to `postRevivePiecesRemaining`
- **Logic**: Updated `onPiecesGenerated()` to decrement by actual pieces (3 per round) instead of 1 per round
- **Methods**: Updated method names and documentation to reflect piece-based tracking

### 2. ReviveHeartSystemTests.swift - Updated Tests

- Modified integration test to use public interface instead of private properties
- Tests still verify the core functionality works correctly

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated `POST_REVIVE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` to reflect 12 pieces instead of 4 rounds
- Created `12_PIECE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` with detailed implementation explanation

## New Behavior

| Event                 | Old System                      | New System                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Revive Used**       | `postReviveRoundsRemaining = 4` | `postRevivePiecesRemaining = 12` |
| **Round 1 Generated** | Remaining: 3 rounds             | Remaining: 9 pieces              |
| **Round 2 Generated** | Remaining: 2 rounds             | Remaining: 6 pieces              |
| **Round 3 Generated** | Remaining: 1 round              | Remaining: 3 pieces              |
| **Round 4 Generated** | Remaining: 0 rounds             | Remaining: 0 pieces              |
| **Result**            | 4 rounds tracked                | **12 pieces tracked** âœ…         |

## Key Improvements

1. **Precise Counting**: Now tracks exactly 12 individual pieces as requested
2. **Clear Intent**: Code explicitly shows 12 pieces instead of abstract "rounds"
3. **Flexible**: Handles edge cases where fewer than 3 pieces might be generated
4. **Maintained Quality**: All existing functionality preserved, enhanced algorithm still guarantees ALL pieces are placeable

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The system now correctly provides **12 guaranteed placeable pieces** after revival, giving players exactly the recovery period they need to get back into the game without getting stuck with unplaceable pieces.
