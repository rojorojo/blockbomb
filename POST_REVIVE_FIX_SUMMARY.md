# Post-Revive Block Prioritization Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

The original post-revive system was not aggressive enough - it only ensured 2 out of 3 pieces were placeable instead of guaranteeing ALL 3 pieces could be placed after revival.

## Root Cause

In the previous `postRevivePrioritySelection()` method:

```swift
// OLD CODE - Only required 2 placeable pieces
if placeableShapes.count >= 2 {
    // ... proceed with selection
} else {
    // Fall back to rescue mode
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Algorithm

- **NEW REQUIREMENT**: ALL 3 pieces must be placeable, not just 2
- **Aggressive Search**: Tries up to 50 attempts to find 3 guaranteed placeable pieces
- **Priority Order**: Smallest, most flexible pieces first

### 2. Priority Hierarchy

1. **Premium versatile pieces** (`.blockSingle` - 1 cell, always fits)
2. **Common filler pieces** (corners, small sticks - 3-4 cells)
3. **Useful line makers** (medium-sized strategic pieces)
4. **Fallback pieces** (any remaining common pieces)

### 3. Smart Sorting

```swift
// Sort by size first, then by utility priority
let sortedCandidates = candidatePieces.sorted { shape1, shape2 in
    if shape1.cells.count != shape2.cells.count {
        return shape1.cells.count < shape2.cells.count  // Smaller first
    }
    // Then by utility: versatile > filler > lineMaker > spaceFiller > bulky
    // ...
}
```

### 4. Verification Loop

```swift
// AGGRESSIVE SEARCH: Keep trying until we find 3 placeable pieces
while prioritySelection.count < count && attempts < maxAttempts {
    for candidate in sortedCandidates {
        if gameBoard.canPlacePieceAnywhere(gridPiece) {
            prioritySelection.append(candidate)
            // Continue until we have all 3
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Final Validation

```swift
// GUARANTEE: Filter out any pieces that somehow became unplaceable
let finalSelection = prioritySelection.filter { shape in
    let gridPiece = GridPiece(shape: shape, color: shape.color)
    return gameBoard.canPlacePieceAnywhere(gridPiece)
}
```

## Key Improvements

| Aspect                | Before                       | After                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Requirement**       | 2/3 pieces placeable         | **3/3 pieces placeable**      |
| **Fallback Strategy** | Fall back to rescue mode     | Keep searching until 3 found  |
| **Priority**          | Basic rescue logic           | **Size-first, utility-based** |
| **Validation**        | Assume pieces stay placeable | **Double-check all pieces**   |
| **Attempts**          | Single pass                  | **Up to 50 attempts**         |

## Guaranteed Placeable Pieces

### Single Block (Premium - 1 cell)

- `.blockSingle` - Can fit anywhere with 1 open cell
- **Utility**: Versatile
- **Rarity**: Premium (5%)

### Corner Pieces (Common - 3 cells)

- `.cornerTopLeft`, `.cornerBottomLeft`, `.cornerTopRight`, `.cornerBottomRight`
- **Utility**: Filler
- **Rarity**: Common (50%)

### Small Sticks (Common - 3 cells)

- `.stick3`, `.stick3Vert`
- **Utility**: Filler
- **Rarity**: Common (50%)

### Small Square (Common - 4 cells)

- `.squareSmall`
- **Utility**: Filler
- **Rarity**: Common (50%)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Post-Revival**: Player uses a revive heart
2. **Activation**: `postRevivePiecesRemaining = 12`
3. **Piece Generation**: For next 12 pieces, use `postRevivePrioritySelection()`
4. **Guarantee**: ALL 3 pieces in each round are guaranteed placeable
5. **Recovery**: Player can always make progress, never stuck with unplaceable pieces

## Testing Added

```swift
@Test func testPostRevivePrioritySelectionAllPlaceable() async throws {
    // Verify ALL shapes returned are actually placeable
    for shape in postReviveShapes {
        let gridPiece = GridPiece(shape: shape, color: shape.color)
        let canPlace = gameBoard.canPlacePieceAnywhere(gridPiece)
        #expect(canPlace, "Post-revive shape \(shape.displayName) should be placeable but isn't")
    }
}
```

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The enhanced post-revive system now guarantees that ALL 3 pieces will be placeable for the next 12 pieces (4 rounds of 3 pieces each) following a revival, addressing the user's concern about being "dead after only two moves" due to unplaceable pieces.
