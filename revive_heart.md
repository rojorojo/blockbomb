Overview

The Revive Heart is a power-up that allows players to continue a game session after a Game Over event. Players can consume a Revive Heart to resume the game from the state it was in just before failure, instead of restarting from scratch.

Behavior
â€¢ Initial Allocation:
â€¢ Each player starts with 3 Revive Hearts in their inventory.
â€¢ This count is stored persistently (e.g., in UserDefaults or a save file).
â€¢ Game Flow Integration: 1. When the player reaches Game Over, show the Game Over screen. 2. If the player has at least 1 Revive Heart, display a Revive button. 3. If the player taps Revive:
â€¢ Deduct 1 Revive Heart from their inventory.
â€¢ Resume the game from just before the failure point.
â€¢ Bypass any restart logic that would normally reset the game.
â€¢ Edge Cases:
â€¢ If the player has 0 Revive Hearts, do not show the Revive option.
â€¢ If the game is resumed using a revive, ensure any score, board state, or ongoing animations are restored accurately.

UI Changes
â€¢ Show the Revive button on the Game Over screen (only if revive hearts > 0).
â€¢ Display a small icon and count for Revive Hearts somewhere on the game HUD (optional, but recommended for visibility).

Storage
â€¢ reviveHeartCount: Integer value tracking the number of available hearts.
â€¢ Should persist across app launches.
â€¢ Can be stored using UserDefaults or another persistent solution.

Notes for Implementation
â€¢ Consider triggering an animation or sound effect when a Revive Heart is used.
â€¢ This mechanic is separate from rewarded ads or IAP for now â€” no monetization logic is needed yet.

## Implementation Prompts

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. **Create ReviveHeartManager - DONE**

   - Create a new file `ReviveHeartManager.swift` in the `Features/ReviveHeart/` directory
   - Implement singleton pattern for managing revive heart count
   - Add UserDefaults persistence for heart count storage
   - Initialize with 3 hearts on first launch
   - Provide methods: `getHeartCount()`, `useHeart()`, `hasHearts()`, `addHearts(count:)`

2. **Create Game State Preservation System - DONE**
   - Extend `GameController` to add methods for saving current game state âœ…
   - Create `GameState` struct to store: board configuration, current score, active piece, next pieces, level/speed âœ…
   - Add `saveGameState()` method to capture state before game over âœ…
   - Add `restoreGameState(_:)` method to resume from saved state âœ…
   - Created `GameStateManager.swift` with complete state preservation system âœ…
   - Added `attemptRevive()` method to GameController that combines heart usage with state restoration âœ…

### Phase 2: Game Flow Integration - DONE

3. **Modify Game Over Logic - DONE**

   - âœ… Update `GameController` to check for revive hearts before showing game over
   - âœ… Save game state when game over is detected (before showing game over screen) - Added to `GameScene+GameLogic.swift` `handleGameOver()` method
   - âœ… Modify game over flow to preserve state instead of immediately resetting
   - âœ… Fixed GameBoard grid accessibility issue (changed from private to internal)

4. **Update GameOverView UI - DONE**
   - âœ… Add conditional revive button to `GameOverView.swift`
   - âœ… Button should only appear when `gameController.canRevive()` returns true (checks both hearts and saved state)
   - âœ… Style the revive button with heart icon and "REVIVE" text
   - âœ… Connect button action to trigger revive process
   - âœ… Updated ContentView to pass gameController and revive callback to GameOverView
   - âœ… Added HeartCountView component to display heart count in main game HUD

### Phase 3: Revive Functionality - DONE

5. **Implement Revive Action - DONE**

   - âœ… Add revive method to `GameController` that:
     - âœ… Calls `ReviveHeartManager.shared.useHeart()`
     - âœ… Restores saved game state
     - âœ… Dismisses game over screen
     - âœ… Resumes gameplay without reset
