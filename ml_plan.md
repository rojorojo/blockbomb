# Machine Learning Model Enhancement Plan

## Model Overview

Your project contains a **Core ML tabular classification model** called "BEMUP-Blocks-Data-Model" that appears to be designed for **piece selection recommendation** in the block puzzle game. The model was created using Apple's CreateML framework on June 10, 2025.

## Current Model Structure

### Input Features:
- **board_capacity**: A numerical value representing how full the board is (0-100% scale)
- **pieces**: An array of available piece names (like "T Shape Tall Left", "Wide Rectangle", etc.)

### Output:
- **chosen_piece**: The recommended piece to place
- **chosen_pieceProbability**: Confidence score for the recommendation

### Training Data Analysis:
- The model was trained on **630+ gameplay scenarios** from `training_data_with_chosen_piece.csv`
- Each record contains:
  - Board capacity percentage (6.2% to 73.4%)
  - Available pieces at that moment
  - Which piece was actually chosen
  - Score delta achieved (15-730 points)
  - Whether lines were cleared (True/False)

## Gameplay Improvement Opportunities

### 1. **Intelligent Piece Selection Assistant** üéØ
The model can provide **real-time piece recommendations** to help players make optimal moves:
- Show a subtle highlight or suggestion for the "best" piece to place next
- Display confidence percentage to help players understand the AI's certainty
- Could be implemented as an optional "hint" system that players can toggle on/off

### 2. **Adaptive Difficulty System** üìà
Use the model to create dynamic difficulty:
- When model confidence is high (>80%), the AI knows there's a clearly optimal move
- When confidence is low (<50%), the situation is more complex/challenging
- Adjust piece generation to maintain optimal challenge level for individual players

### 3. **Educational Feedback** üéì
Help players improve their skills:
- After each move, show what the AI would have recommended
- Explain why certain pieces are better in specific board states
- Track player improvement over time by comparing their choices to AI recommendations

### 4. **Strategic Scoring Optimization** üíØ
The training data shows correlation between piece choice and score outcomes:
- **High-scoring moves** (300+ points) often involve line clears
- **Low-scoring moves** (15-30 points) typically just place pieces without clearing
- Model can help players identify combo opportunities they might miss

### 5. **Game State Analysis** üß†
Based on board capacity patterns in training data:
- **Early game** (6-25% capacity): Focus on foundation building
- **Mid game** (25-50% capacity): Balance placement with line-clear setup
- **Late game** (50%+ capacity): Prioritize immediate line clears and survival

## Data Collection Strategies

### 1. **In-App Analytics Collection** üìä
**Easiest to implement since you already have the infrastructure:**

- Your `AdAnalyticsManager` already tracks game events
- You could extend this to capture every move decision:
  - Board state before move
  - Available pieces
  - Piece actually chosen by player
  - Resulting score delta
  - Whether lines were cleared
  - Player skill indicators (games played, average score, etc.)

### 2. **Silent Background Logging** üîç
**Low friction for players:**

- Collect data during normal gameplay without interrupting the experience
- Store locally and batch upload when WiFi is available
- Use existing game event hooks in `GameController` and `GameScene`
- Privacy-compliant (anonymous gameplay patterns)

### 3. **Optional Feedback System** üéØ
**Higher quality data:**

- Add an optional "Teaching Mode" where players can rate AI suggestions
- "Was this AI recommendation helpful?" after showing hints
- Collect both successful and unsuccessful move outcomes
- Players who opt-in tend to provide higher quality training data

## Technical Implementation Approaches

### Option A: Extend Existing Analytics
```
Your AdAnalyticsManager.swift already has:
- Game completion tracking
- Move counting
- Score tracking

Could add:
- Move-level decision tracking
- Board state serialization  
- Piece selection patterns
```

### Option B: New GameplayDataCollector
```
Create separate service that:
- Observes game state changes
- Captures decision points
- Stores locally with privacy controls
- Syncs when appropriate
```

### Option C: Cloud-Based Collection
```
Use Firebase Analytics or similar to:
- Collect anonymized gameplay sessions
- Aggregate across all players
- Download periodic training data updates
```

## Data Privacy Considerations

### ‚úÖ **What You CAN Collect (Generally Safe):**
- Anonymous gameplay patterns
- Move sequences and outcomes
- Board states and piece selections
- Performance metrics (scores, lines cleared)
- Timing data (how long to make decisions)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Requires Careful Handling:**
- Device identifiers (should be hashed/anonymized)
- Gameplay sessions (should be aggregated)
- User preferences (need consent)

### ‚ùå **What to Avoid:**
- Personal information
- Device-specific data that could identify users
- Gameplay data tied to personal accounts

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
```swift
// Add to GameScene or GameController
func getAIRecommendation(boardState: BoardState, availablePieces: [TetrominoShape]) -> (piece: TetrominoShape, confidence: Float) {
    // Use Core ML model to predict best piece
    let input = BEMUPBlocksDataModelInput(
        board_capacity: boardState.capacityPercentage,
        pieces: availablePieces.map { $0.displayName }
    )
    
    let prediction = try? mlModel.prediction(from: input)
    return (recommendedPiece, confidence)
}
```

### Phase 2: UI Integration
- Add optional "AI Hint" button to the game interface
- Subtle visual indicators (glow effect) on recommended pieces
- Settings toggle to enable/disable AI assistance

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Performance Analytics**: Track how often players follow AI recommendations
- **Personalized Learning**: Adapt recommendations to individual player styles
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Use AI confidence to adjust piece generation algorithms

## Improving Model Quality

### 1. **Diverse Skill Levels**
Your current data might be from one player/skill level. Collecting from:
- Beginner players (more random moves)
- Expert players (optimal strategies)
- Different play styles (aggressive vs. conservative)

### 2. **Varied Game States**
Ensure training data covers:
- Early game (low board capacity)
- Mid game (medium capacity) 
- Late game (high capacity, survival mode)
- Different piece combinations

### 3. **Outcome Correlation**
Currently you track `score_delta` and `line_cleared`, but could add:
- Multi-move sequences (what happens 2-3 moves later)
- Game survival duration
- Combo potential setup moves

## Model Retraining Pipeline

### Phase 1: Data Collection
1. Deploy data collection code
2. Gather 2-4 weeks of gameplay data
3. Aim for 10,000+ diverse decision points
