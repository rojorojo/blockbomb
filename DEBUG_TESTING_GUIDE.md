# Game Over Detection Debug Testing Guide

## Debug Features Implemented

### Enhanced Debug Logging

- **`checkForGameOver()`** in `GameScene+GameLogic.swift` now provides comprehensive debug output
- **`canPlacePieceAnywhere()`** in `GameBoard.swift` shows detailed piece placement analysis
- **`debugPrintBoardState()`** in `GameBoard.swift` displays ASCII representation of board state

### Debug Test Buttons

Four new debug buttons have been added to the game interface:

1. **"Test Game Over"** (Orange text, bottom right)

   - Creates a nearly full board with specific empty spaces
   - Automatically triggers game over check
   - Tests general game over detection

2. **"Test Bug Scenario"** (Red text, bottom right)

   - Creates the exact scenario reported in the bug
   - Sets up a nearly full board with specific problematic pieces
   - Tests the exact combination that should trigger game over but doesn't

3. **"Nearly Full Board"** (Yellow text, bottom right)

   - Creates a nearly full board without triggering game over check
   - Allows manual testing of piece placement

4. **"Reset Hearts"** (Red text, already existed)
   - Resets revive hearts to 3 for testing revive scenarios

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Debug Version

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Build and run on simulator or device
3. You should see the new debug buttons at the bottom of the screen

### Step 2: Test the Reported Bug Scenario

#### Option A: Test Bug Scenario Button (Recommended)

1. Tap **"Test Bug Scenario"** button
2. This recreates the EXACT situation reported in the bug:
   - Creates a nearly full board with strategic empty spaces
   - Sets up specific pieces (5-block horizontal, L-shape, T-shape) that are hard to place
   - Automatically triggers game over check
3. This should demonstrate the issue where game over doesn't trigger when it should

#### Option B: General Test Game Over Button

1. Tap **"Test Game Over"** button
2. This creates a board with these empty spaces:
   - 5-cell horizontal line at row 2, columns 1-5
   - L-shaped area at bottom right (rows 6-7, columns 6-7)
   - Single cells at (0,0) and (4,3)
3. The game will automatically check for game over after 0.1 seconds

### Step 3: Analyze Debug Output

Watch the console for detailed output like:

```
DEBUG: Starting game over check with 3 pieces
DEBUG: Current board capacity: 85.9%
DEBUG: Current board state (8x8):
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
  0: · █ █ █ █ █ █ █
  1: █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █
  2: █ · · · · · █ █
  ...
DEBUG: Current pieces: [Shape1, Shape2, Shape3]
DEBUG: Piece placement results:
  - Shape1: CAN/CANNOT place
  - Shape2: CAN/CANNOT place
  - Shape3: CAN/CANNOT place
```

### Step 4: Test Different Piece Combinations

1. If game over doesn't trigger correctly, note which pieces are available
2. Tap **"Nearly Full Board"** to reset the test scenario
3. Try placing different pieces manually to see what fits
4. Use the **"View All Shapes"** button to see all available piece types

## What to Look For

### Expected Behavior

- Game over should trigger when NO pieces can be placed in ANY available space
- Debug output should clearly show which pieces can/cannot be placed
- Board state visualization should match the actual game board

### Potential Issues to Identify

1. **False Negatives**: Game over doesn't trigger when it should

   - Look for pieces that report "CANNOT place" but actually could fit
   - Check if `canPlacePiece()` logic is working correctly

2. **False Positives**: Game over triggers when pieces can still be placed

   - Look for pieces that report "CAN place" but game over still triggers
   - Check for timing issues or state inconsistencies

3. **Piece Shape Issues**: Incorrect piece shape definitions

   - Compare visual piece shapes with their grid cell definitions
   - Verify piece rotation handling (if any)

4. **Board State Issues**: Board state not matching visual representation
   - Compare debug ASCII output with actual game board
   - Check for ghost pieces or pending clear states affecting placement

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you run this debug version and capture the output, we can:

1. **Identify the Root Cause**: Determine exactly why game over detection fails
2. **Implement the Fix**: Apply the appropriate solution based on findings
3. **Verify the Solution**: Test that the fix works correctly
4. **Remove Debug Code**: Clean up debug output for production

## Logging the Results

When testing, please capture:

1. The complete console debug output
2. Screenshots of the board state when the bug occurs
3. Which pieces were available when game over should have triggered
4. Any discrepancies between expected and actual behavior

This comprehensive debug system should reveal exactly what's happening during the game over detection process and help us fix the issue once and for all.
