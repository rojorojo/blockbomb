**ðŸŽ® GAME STATUS:** Fully complete ad-supported currency system with visual feedback!

## Overview

Implement an ad-supported free game model where players must watch ads to earn points and continue playing. Points are exchanged for essential powerups like revive hearts. Since this is a free game without in-app purchases, ads are the primary monetization and progression mechanism. The system will be built modularly to support future powerups and maintain the existing game architecture.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

### 1.1 Points/Currency System (Core Foundation)

**AI Prompt:**

```
Create a points/currency system for the BlockBomb iOS game to support ad rewards and powerup purchases. Build on the existing architecture:

Requirements:
- Create `PowerupCurrencyManager.swift` in `/Features/Currency/` directory
- Singleton pattern with UserDefaults persistence (like ReviveHeartManager)
- Use @Published properties for SwiftUI integration
- Default starting balance: 0 points
- Methods: `getPoints()`, `addPoints(amount)`, `spendPoints(amount)`, `hasEnoughPoints(amount)`
- Points earned: 10 per ad watched (configurable)
- Integration with existing debug panel for testing
- Logging for all point transactions

Follow the same architectural patterns as ReviveHeartManager.swift for consistency.
```

## Technical Considerations

### Monetization Strategy

- **Ad-supported currency system**: Ads earn coins/points, not direct continues
- **Revive hearts as progression gate**: Only revive hearts allow continued play
- **Coin economy**: Clear separation between earning (ads) and spending (shop)
- **Value proposition**: Players earn currency through ads, spend strategically on powerups
- **Emergency fallbacks**: Graceful handling when ads are unavailable
- **Scalable**: System designed to support future powerups and monetization optimization

### Integration Points

- **ReviveHeartManager**: Seamless integration for heart purchases
- **GameController**: Ad display timing and game state management
- **UI Components**: Consistent theming with existing BlockColors system
- **Debug Panel**: Testing interface for all reward system features

### Privacy and Compliance

- **GDPR Compliance**: Proper consent management for ads
- **COPPA Compliance**: Age-appropriate ad content
- **App Store Guidelines**: Adherence to Apple's advertising policies
- **User Understanding**: Clear communication that ads support the free game model
- **Fair Play**: Reasonable ad frequency that doesn't frustrate players

### Economy Balance

- **Points per ad**: 10 points (configurable)
- **Revive heart cost**: 20 points (2 ads required to earn enough for 1 heart)
- **Ad frequency**: Coin-earning opportunities + interstitials every 2-3 games
- **Starting balance**: 0 points (players must watch ads to earn currency)
- **Emergency hearts**: Small buffer (1-2 hearts) when ads fail to load
- **Progression gate**: Revive hearts are the only way to continue - no direct ad continues

### Architecture Alignment

- **Existing Patterns**: Follow ReviveHeartManager singleton pattern
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Use @Published properties and @ObservedObject
- **Testing Framework**: Extend existing test suite structure
- **Debug Integration**: Add to existing DebugPanelView
- **Audio/Visual**: Match existing animation and sound patterns

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing an ad-supported currency system that enhances the existing game while maintaining its high-quality user experience and technical architecture. The focus is on providing coin-earning opportunities through ads while preserving the core mechanic that only revive hearts allow continued play.
