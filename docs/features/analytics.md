# Firebase Analytics Integration Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ FEATURE OVERVIEW

**Streamlined Firebase Analytics Integration**

Replace existing local analytics with Firebase Analytics throughout the BlockBomb iOS game to track essential gameplay, performance, and monetization metrics. Focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) while maintaining opt-in privacy compliance for US/Europe markets with COPPA considerations for users under 13.

## ðŸ“Š ANALYTICS GOALS & KPIs

**Primary KPIs to Track:**

- **Gameplay**: Game start, game over, session length, high score milestones
- **Monetization**: Ad impressions, ad views, power shop purchases, revive hearts usage
- **Engagement**: DAU (Daily Active Users), MAU (Monthly Active Users), onboarding completion
- **Performance**: App performance metrics, offline sync capabilities
- **Retention**: User lifetime value (LTV) tracking
- **Multiplayer**: Separate tracking for multiplayer vs single-player sessions

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Gameplay**: Game start, game over, session length, high score milestones
- **Monetization**: Ad impressions, ad views, revive hearts usage, power shop purchases
- **Engagement**: DAU/MAU, onboarding completion, user lifetime value
- **Performance**: App launch time, offline sync efficiency
- **Multiplayer**: Separate tracking from single-player metrics

### Privacy and Compliance

- **Opt-in Analytics**: Default to opt-in with clear user consent
- **Age Verification**: Disable analytics for users under 13 (COPPA)
- **Geographic Compliance**: US/Europe market focus (GDPR considerations)
- **Data Minimization**: Track only essential KPIs, no PII collection

### Performance Optimization

- **Battery Efficiency**: Optimize analytics operations for minimal battery impact
- **Offline Sync**: Store events locally and sync when network available
- **Event Batching**: Process events efficiently to minimize performance impact
- **Memory Management**: Efficient event queuing and processing
