# Play with Friends Multiplayer Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ FEATURE OVERVIEW

**Game Center Turn-Based Competitive Block Puzzle**

Implement a turn-based multiplayer feature using Game Center where two players compete for the highest score on separate 8x8 grids. Players alternate turns with identical piece sets, ensuring fair skill-based competition. The game supports asynchronous play with no time limits, and either player can end the game at any time.

## ðŸŽ® GAME FLOW SUMMARY

1. **Match Creation**: Player creates or joins a Game Center turn-based match
2. **Turn System**: Players alternate, each receiving the same 3 pieces per turn
3. **Separate Grids**: Each player has their own 8x8 grid and score
4. **Score Competition**: Players compete for the highest individual score
5. **Flexible Ending**: Game ends when a player can't place pieces or either player chooses to end
6. **Winner Determination**: Player with highest score wins the match
