# Play with Friends Multiplayer Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ FEATURE OVERVIEW

**Multiplayer Block Puzzle Game with GameCenter Integration**

Implement a turn-based multiplayer feature where players use GameCenter to connect and compete in synchronized block puzzle matches. Each player has their own 8x8 grid, takes turns with the same 3 pieces, and competes for the highest score. The game uses GameCenter's turn-based multiplayer APIs for reliable, asynchronous gameplay.

## ðŸŽ® GAME FLOW SUMMARY

1. **Connection**: Player 1 uses GameCenter to connect with Player 2 by entering their GameCenter ID
2. **Game Start**: Player 2 accepts the game request and the game begins
3. **Turn System**: Players alternate turns, each seeing the same 3 pieces per round
4. **Score Competition**: Both players maintain separate grids and scores, competing for highest total
5. **Game End**: Game ends when one player cannot place pieces, winner determined by highest score
6. **Emergency Controls**: Either player can end the game at any time with an "End Game" button
